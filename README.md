# UFit Prototype

## Overview

Welcome to the UFit Prototype repository! This project is part of my coursework in User-Centered Design, where I utilized #JustInMind to create a streamlined and user-friendly system prototype. The primary aim of UFit is to minimize friction in the personal training experience, making it easy for trainers to sign up and users to book sessions at their preferred locations.

## Features

- **User-Focused Design:** The prototype emphasizes a user-centered approach, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for both personal trainers and users.
  
- **Friction Reduction:** UFit is designed to minimize the hurdles in the process of scheduling and participating in private training sessions, offering a hassle-free solution.
